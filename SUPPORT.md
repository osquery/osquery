# Welcome to osquery!

We use GitHub for tracking bugs, feature requests and blueprints only, so this isn't the right
place to get support. However we're still happy to help, checkout the resources bellows and feel
free to reach out on osquery Slack.

## Slack

You can register on our Slack using our [shared invite](https://join.slack.com/t/osquery/shared_invite/zt-1wi6cdgf7-zR2wt7FZ0ClHj6tEym6KFQ).
Before posting to the `general` channel take a look at other available channels where your question might be a better fit.
If you have a question about a vendor solution post **only** on the vendor specific channel.
